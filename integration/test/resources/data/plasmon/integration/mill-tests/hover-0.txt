```scala
class DynamicVariable
```

***

`DynamicVariables` provide a binding mechanism where the current
 value is found through dynamic scope, but where access to the
 variable itself is resolved through static scope.

 The current value can be retrieved with the value method. New values
 should be pushed using the `withValue` method. Values pushed via
 `withValue` only stay valid while the `withValue`'s second argument, a
 parameterless closure, executes. When the second argument finishes,
 the variable reverts to the previous value.

```
someDynamicVariable.withValue(newValue) {
  // ... code called in here that calls value ...
  // ... will be given back the newValue ...
}
```
 Each thread gets its own stack of bindings.  When a
 new thread is created, the `DynamicVariable` gets a copy
 of the stack of bindings from the parent thread, and
 from then on the bindings for the new thread
 are independent of those for the original thread.
