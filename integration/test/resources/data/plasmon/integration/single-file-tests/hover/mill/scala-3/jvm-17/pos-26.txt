```scala
def getContextClassLoader(): ClassLoader
```

***

Returns the context `ClassLoader` for this thread. The context
`ClassLoader` is provided by the creator of the thread for use
by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
If not [set](#setContextClassLoader), the default is the
`ClassLoader` context of the parent thread. The context
`ClassLoader` of the
primordial thread is typically set to the class loader used to load the
application.
