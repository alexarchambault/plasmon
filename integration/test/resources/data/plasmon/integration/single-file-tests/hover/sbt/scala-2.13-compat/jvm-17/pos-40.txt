```scala
type String: String
```

***

The `String` type in Scala has all the methods of the underlying
 [java.lang.String](java.lang.String), of which it is just an alias.

 In addition, extension methods in [scala.collection.StringOps](scala.collection.StringOps)
 are added implicitly through the conversion [augmentString](augmentString).
