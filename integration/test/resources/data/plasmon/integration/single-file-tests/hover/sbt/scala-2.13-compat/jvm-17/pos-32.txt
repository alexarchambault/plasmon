```scala
def toASCIIString(): String
```

***

Returns the content of this URI as a US-ASCII string.

 If this URI does not contain any characters in the *other*
category then an invocation of this method will return the same value as
an invocation of the [toString](#toString()) method.  Otherwise
this method works as if by invoking that method and then [encoding]() the result.
