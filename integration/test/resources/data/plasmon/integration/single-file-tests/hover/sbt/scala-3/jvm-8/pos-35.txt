```scala
def availableProcessors(): Int
```

***

Returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine.

 This value may change during a particular invocation of the virtual
machine.  Applications that are sensitive to the number of available
processors should therefore occasionally poll this property and adjust
their resource usage appropriately.
