```scala
def getContextClassLoader(): ClassLoader
```

***

Returns the context ClassLoader for this Thread. The context
ClassLoader is provided by the creator of the thread for use
by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
If not [set](#setContextClassLoader), the default is the
ClassLoader context of the parent Thread. The context ClassLoader of the
primordial thread is typically set to the class loader used to load the
application.

If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is not
`null` and is not the same as or an ancestor of the context class
loader, then this method invokes the security manager's [
SecurityManager#checkPermission(java.security.Permission) checkPermission](
SecurityManager#checkPermission(java.security.Permission) checkPermission)
method with a [RuntimePermission](RuntimePermission)`
("getClassLoader")` permission to verify that retrieval of the context
class loader is permitted.
