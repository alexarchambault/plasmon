```scala
def toURI(): URI
```

***

Returns a [java.net.URI](java.net.URI) equivalent to this URL.
This method functions in the same way as `new URI (this.toString())`.
Note, any URL instance that complies with RFC 2396 can be converted
to a URI. However, some URLs that are not strictly in compliance
can not be converted to a URI.
