***

Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
(images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
that is independent of the location of the code.

 The name of a resource is a `/`-separated path name that
identifies the resource.

 Resources in named modules are subject to the encapsulation rules
specified by [Module.getResourceAsStream](Module#getResourceAsStream).
Additionally, and except for the special case where the resource has a
name ending with "`.class`", this method will only find resources in
packages of named modules when the package is [opened](Module#isOpen(String)) unconditionally (even if the caller of this method is in the
same module as the resource).
